* Cache album art's Drawable from Activity#onRetainNonConfigurationInstance()
  so it doesn't need to be re-retrieved from the network.

* Deal with orientation change.  Include widescreen layout xml.

* Browsing music & all that.

* Pandora like/dislike buttons.

* Pandora disable back button when in Pandora mode.

* Wait for Wifi when connection fails & try again.  (auto-kick
  Wifi too...?)

* Auto-connect when Wifi state becomes available.

* screen/sleep lock option? "party remote mode"

* use NIO for parsing input and allocate less big Strings objects in
  the service.

* When switching from SqueezerActivity to settings, we disconnect from
  the service, so the service unsubscribes from the server, which
  means we don't get song position updates anymore.  Then when switching
  back to the SqueezerActivity, the time is behind for a second.
  Possible Solutions:

     -- dead-reckoning calculation by service?
     -- easier: have SqueezerActivity tell Service not to unsubscribe
        for 'n' seconds?
