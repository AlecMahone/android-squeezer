Reasons not to merge (aka, bugs to fix):

- Context disclosure triangle in Now Playing is not coloured.

- Inconsistent results between mini player and full screen.  Since they operate on different
  sized versions of the bitmap they may choose different colours.  The mini player should
  operate on the same size bitmap that the full screen player uses.
